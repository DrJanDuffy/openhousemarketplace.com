# Open Graph images

Social share image used by the site is referenced in the root layout:

- **Path:** `og-image.jpg` (this folder)
- **Dimensions:** 1200×630 px
- **Use:** Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other platforms when links to the site are shared.

Add `og-image.jpg` here so shares show a proper preview. Suggested content: Summerlin West / Las Vegas real estate, with text overlay such as “Summerlin West Open Houses | Dr. Jan Duffy Real Estate” or “Schedule a private showing.”

**Fallback:** Until `og-image.jpg` is added, About, Contact, and Open Houses use `https://www.openhousemarketplace.com/images/dr-jan-duffy.jpg` so social shares do not 404.

See `public/images/ASSETS.md` for the full asset checklist.
