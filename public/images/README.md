# Public images – hyper-local, service-focused

Images here are served at `/images/...`. Every folder should contain **hyper-local** (Summerlin West, Las Vegas, Red Rock, zip 89135/89138/89144) and **service-focused** (open houses, MLS search, new construction, luxury homes, neighborhoods) assets.

| Folder | Purpose | Add |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **logo/** | Site/office branding | logo.svg (included), logo.png. Hyper-local: Summerlin West, Dr. Jan Duffy Real Estate. |
| **og/** | Social share (1200×630) | og-image.jpg: Summerlin + services CTA (listings, open houses, new construction). |
| **hero/** | Page banners | hero-home.jpg, hero-neighborhoods.jpg, etc. Hyper-local photos + service focus. |

See **ASSETS.md** in this folder for the full checklist and naming rules.
